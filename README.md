## Overview

Nationwide, there were disproportionately more pharmacy deserts in Black and Latino communities than in white or diverse neighborhoods, according to a 2021 study. They are also more likely to see pharmacy closures.

A Baltimore Banner data analysis found majority-Black and majority-minority neighborhoods do have a slight disadvantage in access to pharmacies. The average distance of all properties in Baltimore to a pharmacy is about three-tenths of a mile. The median is about a quarter of a mile. Blocks in majority-Black and majority-minority neighborhoods were just above average, and majority-white and majority-Hispanic neighborhoods were just below.

## Methodology
### How we analyzed phmaracy deserts in Baltimore City

This analysis of Baltimore pharmacy deserts used [real property](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/maps/real-property-information-2) and [neighborhood datasets](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/datasets/f63445d9528349febb81f0b89cd8be5b_0/explore?location=-0.000000%2C0.000000%2C0.65) from the city of Baltimore and a database of licensed pharmacies from the Maryland Board of Pharmacy. The analysis measures the distance between every city block to the nearest pharmacy, including those in the county. Claims about neighborhoods were made by averaging the distance between all blocks and their nearest pharmacy. Distances were measured in miles as the crow flies; without regard for the distance one would have to travel using sidewalks or roads. 

The 2020 Decennial Census was used to classify neighborhoods by majority racial or ethnic group. A neighborhood was considered majority Black, white or Hispanic if 50% plus one of its population was one of those groups. A majority minority neighborhood was any neighborhood that failed to meet that definition. Race always refers to non-Hispanic populations of any age. Change was calculated raw and as a percentage change.

This analysis of the U.S. 2020 Decennial Census was created using Big Local News Census 2020 Co-op version. This [version of the data](https://biglocalnews.org/content/collaborations/census-data-cooperative.html) include calculations created by the Associated Press. It has already accounted for moving tracts.

Crosswalks between city neighborhoods were made in the SF library. Water was removed using the Tigris library. Intersections were calculated as a share of Census tract. Values for the tract were multiplied by the share. Numbers counting people were rounded to the nearest whole.
